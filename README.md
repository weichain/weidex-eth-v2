# Introduction

### What is weiDex?

The _weiDex_ team has one mission - they strive to deliver the best services and experience to the traders who use their ecosystem. They are all about the idea that nobody should depend on third-parties because it is better for users to have full control over their assets.

WeiDex Foundation’s ultimate aim is to fix the broken blockchain ecosystem on the application layer. The core team decided to start with one of the most fundamental applications for any given network — decentralized exchange. Since 2017, weiDex is working on modular blockchain agnostic DApp Ecosystem for exchanges. It includes not only smart contracts, js wrappers, APIs, but also working DApps for web, desktop, and mobile. These DApps are meant to be blockchain agnostic, device agnostic, with easy and simple interface plus built-in support for decentralized cross-chain exchanges.

In a short conclusion, WeiDex is a Blockchain Agnostic dApp Ecosystem for Exchanges - Providing friendly exchange user interface which is connected with multiple blockchains - Ethereum, Aeternity, Bitcoin, Cardano, etc.

### How does it work?

WeiDex uses a numerous Ethereum Smart Contracts \(currently written in Solidity\), splitting the logic into separated modules. Thus, modules can be upgraded separately. Modularity is achieved through inheritance. The Upgradability is achieved through a separate Smart Contract and users could choose to use the new version for himself or stick with the old one.
